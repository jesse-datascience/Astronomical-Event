# CI/CD Pipeline Documentation

This document provides an overview of the `main.yml` GitHub Actions workflow in the project. The workflow is designed for continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) purposes, ensuring code quality and facilitating automatic deployments to Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

## Workflow Overview

- **Filename**: `.github/workflows/main.yml`
- **Trigger Events**: The workflow is triggered on push and pull requests to the `main` branch.
- **Environment**: The workflow runs on the latest Ubuntu runner provided by GitHub Actions.

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Checkout Repository

- **Purpose**: Checks out the repository code, allowing the workflow to access it.
- **Action Used**: `actions/checkout@v2`

### 2. Set up Python

- **Purpose**: Sets up a specified version of Python in the runner environment, which is necessary for running Python scripts, tests, and other Python-related commands.
- **Action Used**: `actions/setup-python@v2`
- **Python Version**: '3.x'

### 3. Install Dependencies

- **Purpose**: Installs the necessary Python dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
- **Commands**: Upgrades `pip` and installs dependencies via `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

### 4. Format Code with Black

- **Purpose**: Checks the formatting of the codebase using Black, ensuring adherence to coding style standards.
- **Tool Used**: Black (Python code formatter)
- **Commands**: Install Black and run `black --check .` to check code formatting.

### 5. Lint with Flake8

- **Purpose**: Lints the codebase using Flake8 to catch issues such as syntax errors, stylistic errors, and other potential bugs.
- **Tool Used**: Flake8
- **Commands**: Install Flake8 and run linting checks across the codebase.

### 6. Authenticate with Google Cloud

- **Purpose**: Authenticates with Google Cloud Platform to allow deployment and other GCP operations.
- **Action Used**: `google-github-actions/setup-gcloud@master`
- **Details**: Sets up GCP credentials using secrets like `GCP_PROJECT_ID` and `GCP_SA_KEY`.

## Additional Steps

- The workflow currently includes placeholders for additional steps like testing and deploying the application to GCP. These should be customized based on the project's specific requirements and deployment strategies.

## Security

- Sensitive information and credentials are handled using GitHub Secrets, ensuring security and privacy.

## Customization

- This workflow can be customized to include additional steps like automated testing, different deployment commands, and handling different branch strategies as needed by the project.
